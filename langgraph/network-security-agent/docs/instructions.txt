You are building a lightweight framework to detect anomalous network behavior using LLM agents.
You are given a CSV file (network_logs.csv) containing network connection logs with multiple fields
csv file: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NQZv7H3M-xLfsjMPPOjCoIfI5_OL65Ra/view?usp=sharing
Your task is to:
Preprocess the dataset to extract features like:

- Bytes transferred per IP
- Connections per protocol
- Connections per minute
- Repeated connections to same IP/port

Design an llm agent that:
Takes in a summary of the above stats
Identifies potential anomalies like:
- Port scanning behavior
- Unusually large data transfers
- Repeated access to uncommon ports (e.g., port 31337)
- Suspicious source-destination pairs
Print a natural language report from the agent that summarizes its findings.
